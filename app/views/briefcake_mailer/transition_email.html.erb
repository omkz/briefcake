    <p>
        First of all, thanks so much for using RSSMailer.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to better serve our growing userbase, we are rebranding to 
        Briefcake and introducing some new features. Our core mission 
        remains the same through this exciting update but there are a 
        couple of things worth mentioning:
    </p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc">
        <li>
            When you create your personal newsletter link, you can now add as many feeds as you like
        </li>
        <li>
            We've been fighting off bots quite a bit recently so have made a few security improvements
        </li>
        <li>
            Our commitment to privacy is increasingly important and we have finally published a long overdue Privacy Policy
        </li>
        <li>
            The <a href="https://blog.briefcake.com">Briefcake blog</a> is now live and it's where we will be curating our favorite creators across different categories (open source and guest posts welcome)
        </li>
        <li>
            Along with the rebrand comes new pricing of $25/year for PRO, but for our existing customers we will honor lifetime pricing of $12/year
        </li>
    </ul>
    

    <p>
        Everything should migrate without a hitch, but we ask that you keep an eye on spam just in case mail from the new briefcake.com domain ends up there. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We've planned to make the switch on 2 October 2020.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thanks again for your support over the months and years.
    </p>

    <p>
        Best regards,
    </p>

    <p>
