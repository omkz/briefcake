    Perhaps you've got an RSS reader, or folders full of bookmarks, that you last opened FOREVER ago. You're not alone. It's actually pretty hard to make checking your favorite websites part of your daily routine.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
    That's why we're here with an rss feed reader, that instead of listing new items in an app, sends them in a beautifully simple, daily email.

            question: "Does it only work with RSS?",
            answer: "RSS works great for most sites, but because Instagram doesn't offer an RSS feed we have a custom crawler for public Instagram profiles. You can add those by supplying the user's profile url."
