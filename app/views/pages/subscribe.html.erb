  <p class="mb-8 text-lg text-gray-700">
    When I was building RSSMailer
    <a href="https://twitter.com/jankeesvw/status/1161519867335454721">I got some feedback</a> from
    content creators that asked if there was a way to use RSSMailer as a newsletter sending service.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-8 text-lg text-gray-700">
    I worked on this for the last couple of days and now you are able to do this. All you have to do
    is; create a sign up form.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4">How it works</h2>

  <p class="mb-8 text-lg text-gray-700">Every user can create a form from their account by
    navigating to the
    <%= link_to "Create personal newsletter", edit_subscribe_form_path %> page.</p>


  <div class="bg-white p-3 pt-10 shadow-lg rounded mb-10">
    <%= image_tag "form.jpg", alt: "Quickly create a form" %>
  </div>

  <p class="mb-8 text-lg text-gray-700">If you then visit your unique URL you get a sign
    up form that allow your readers to stay up by email.</p>

  <div class="mb-4 bg-white shadow-lg rounded p-2 py-20 mb-10 flex items-center justify-around">
    <%= image_tag "subscribe.jpg", alt: "Subscribe form", style: "max-width: 400px; width: 100%" %>
  </div>

  <p class="mb-40 text-lg text-gray-700">If you want to know more about my product check
    the <%= link_to "about page", about_path %>.</p>
</div>
