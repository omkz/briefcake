        <blockquote>
          <p>I love <em>fast</em> software. That is, software speedy both in function
        and interface. Software with minimal to no lag between wanting to
        activate or manipulate something and the thing happening.
        Lightness.</p>

        <p>Software that’s speedy usually means it’s focused. Like a good
        tool, it often means that it’s simple, but that’s not
        necessarily true. Speed in software is probably the most
        valuable, least valued asset. To me, speedy software is the
        difference between an application smoothly integrating into your
        life, and one called upon with great reluctance. Fastness in
        software is like great margins in a book — makes you smile
        without necessarily knowing why.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>I love this essay so much I wish I could kiss it. One of the confounding aspects of software today is that our computers are literally hundreds — maybe even a thousand — times faster than the ones we used 20 years ago, but some simple tasks take longer now than they did then. Opening the Web Export dialog in Photoshop, for example.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Tasked with overseeing the most high-profile investigation of our
        time, Mueller managed to complete the investigation without
        appearing to have a partisan agenda, with both sides embracing him
        at times. Even Trump said he acted “honorably” — before he turned
        on Mueller as “conflicted” and partisan — and touted “total
        exoneration” soon after Mueller concluded his work. Mueller’s
        down-the-middle, leak-free handling of the high-stakes
        investigation was an object lesson in professionalism.</p>

        <p>And Wednesday’s performance was no different.</p>

        his performance, he is far better than his critics and remains an

        <blockquote>
          <p>Intel and Apple have signed an agreement for Apple to acquire the majority of Intel’s smartphone modem business. Approximately 2,200 Intel employees will join Apple, along with intellectual property, equipment and leases. The transaction, valued at $1 billion, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions, including works council and other relevant consultations in certain jurisdictions.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>No surprise here. 2,200 new employees sounds like a lot, but they’re just going to keep working on what they were already working on: cellular modems. Remember this bit of <a href="https://fortune.com/2009/01/22/the-cook-doctrine-at-apple/">the Cook Doctrine</a>: “We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products that we make.” If anything, Apple waited too long to take control of its modems the way it has its SoC’s.</p>

        <p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/07/apple-to-acquire-the-majority-of-intels-smartphone-modem-business/">Here’s Apple’s press release</a>. The big tell: their executive quote is from Johny Srouji.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“We’ve worked with Intel for many years and know this team shares Apple’s passion for designing technologies that deliver the world’s best experiences for our users,” said Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. “Apple is excited to have so many excellent engineers join our growing cellular technologies group, and know they’ll thrive in Apple’s creative and dynamic environment. They, together with our significant acquisition of innovative IP, will help expedite our development on future products and allow Apple to further differentiate moving forward.”</p>

          <p>Eager to test out a technology that’s been more hyped than flavored sparkling water, I embarked on a 5G expedition from Denver to Atlanta to Chicago to Manhattan’s Lower East Side. I mostly used the new, $1,300 Samsung Galaxy S10 5G, one of the first 5G phones and the only one available across all the carriers. I also tested the LG V50 ThinQ 5G on Sprint’s network; Verizon has a version but I didn’t test it.</p>

        <p>After nearly 120 tests, more than 12 city miles walked and a couple of big blisters, I can report that 5G is fasten-your-seat-belt fast… when you can find it. And you’re standing outdoors. And the temperature is just right.</p>

        <p>Jane Mayer, in a remarkably deeply researched piece for The New Yorker:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>A remarkable number of Franken’s Senate colleagues have regrets about their own roles in his fall. Seven current and former U.S. senators who demanded Franken’s resignation in 2017 told me that they’d been wrong to do so. Such admissions are unusual in an institution whose members rarely concede mistakes. Patrick Leahy, the veteran Democrat from Vermont, said that his decision to seek Franken’s resignation without first getting all the facts was “one of the biggest mistakes I’ve made” in forty-five years in the Senate. Heidi Heitkamp, the former senator from North Dakota, told me, “If there’s one decision I’ve made that I would take back, it’s the decision to call for his resignation. It was made in the heat of the moment, without concern for exactly what this was.” Tammy Duckworth, the junior Democratic senator from Illinois, told me that the Senate Ethics Committee “should have been allowed to move forward.” She said it was important to acknowledge the trauma that Franken’s accusers had gone through, but added, “We needed more facts. That due process didn’t happen is not good for our democracy.” Angus King, the Independent senator from Maine, said that he’d “regretted it ever since” he joined the call for Franken’s resignation. “There’s no excuse for sexual assault,” he said. “But Al deserved more of a process. I don’t denigrate the allegations, but this was the political equivalent of capital punishment.” Senator Jeff Merkley, of Oregon, told me, “This was a rush to judgment that didn’t allow any of us to fully explore what this was about. I took the judgment of my peers rather than independently examining the circumstances. In my heart, I’ve not felt right about it.” Bill Nelson, the former Florida senator, said, “I realized almost right away I’d made a mistake. I felt terrible. I should have stood up for due process to render what it’s supposed to — the truth.” Tom Udall, the senior Democratic senator from New Mexico, said, “I made a mistake. I started having second thoughts shortly after he stepped down. He had the right to be heard by an independent investigative body. I’ve heard from people around my state, and around the country, saying that they think he got railroaded. It doesn’t seem fair. I’m a lawyer. I really believe in due process.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>That’s quite a paragraph.</p>

        <p>First and foremost, I think Mayer makes an incredibly solid case that Franken was railroaded. When the scandal first broke, Franken himself immediately called for a Senate Ethics Committee investigation. That investigation should have been allowed to run its course, and it seems clear now, based on Mayer’s reporting, that his resignation was not called for.</p>

        <p>Second, the Democrats lost their single best television presence. It <em>shouldn’t</em> be this way but it is: being good at TV is very good for politics. However repugnant you think Donald Trump is as a man and as a president, there’s no denying that he is <em>very</em> good at being on TV — he hosted a prime time network TV show for over a dozen years, and likely would still be hosting it today if, you know, he hadn’t been elected president. Ronald Reagan was underestimated by the political class because he was “just an actor”, but that’s exactly why he should have been taken very seriously from the moment he entered politics: he was amazingly good at being on TV.</p>

        <p>Franken is very smart, very funny, and very good at being on TV — and he was great at making his questioning in Senate hearings work for TV. I’m not saying Democrats should have looked the other way at egregious behavior just because he was good on TV, but Franken’s importance to the party at a national level should have at least made them look twice at whether what he’d actually done was actually egregious.</p>

        <h6 class="dateline">Tuesday, 23 July 2019</h6>

        <p>Mike Davidson, “<a href="https://mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2019/07/superhumans-superficial-privacy-fixes-do-not-prevent-it-from-spying-on-you">Superhuman’s Superficial Privacy Fixes Do Not Prevent It From Spying on You</a>”:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Last week was a good week for privacy. Or was it?</p>

        <p>It took <a href="https://mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2019/06/superhuman-is-spying-on-you">an article I almost didn’t publish</a> and tens of
        thousands of people <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fmikeindustries.com%2Fblog%2Farchive%2F2019%2F06%2Fsuperhuman-is-spying-on-you&amp;src=typed_query">saying they were creeped out</a>, but
        Superhuman <a href="https://blog.superhuman.com/read-statuses-bdf0cc34b6a5">admitted they were wrong and reduced the danger that
        their surveillance pixels introduce</a>. Good on Rahul Vohra and
        team for that.</p>

        <p>I will say, however, that I’m a little surprised how quickly some
        people are rolling over and giving Superhuman credit for fixing a
        problem that they didn’t actually fix. From tech press articles
        implying that the company quickly closed all of its privacy
        issues, to friends sending me nice notes, I don’t think people are
        paying close enough attention here. This is not “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Accomplished_speech">Mission
        Accomplished</a>” for ethical product design or privacy — at all.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>If you haven’t been following this saga from earlier this month, it’s well worth your time to read the whole thing, including <a href="https://mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2019/06/superhuman-is-spying-on-you">Davidson’s original post</a> and Superhuman CEO Rahul Vohra’s genuinely thoughtful — but ultimately unsatisfying — <a href="https://blog.superhuman.com/read-statuses-bdf0cc34b6a5">response</a>.</p>

        <p>Basically, Superhuman is an invitation-only Gmail front-end whose users seem to genuinely love it. But they embed tracking pixels in emails by default, and use these pixels to show the sender when (and until last week, <em>where</em>, which is truly fucked up) the recipient views them. They call them “read receipts”, and functionally they do work like read receipts, insofar as they indicate when you read a message. But real email read receipts are under the <em>recipient’s</em> control, and they’re a simple binary flag, read or unread — they don’t tell the sender how many times or when you view a message.</p>

        <p>I know that mailing list software generally includes tracking pixels. I don’t think that’s ethical either. On a personal level, though, with Superhuman, tracking when and how many times a recipient views a message is simply absurdly wrong.</p>

        <p>It’s also something the vast, overwhelming majority of people don’t even realize is possible. I’ve told the basic Superhuman tracking story to a few people over the last few weeks, and asked whether they realized this was possible; all of them expressed shock and many of them outrage as well. Email should be private, <em>and most people assume, incorrectly, that it is</em>. You have to be a web developer of some sort to understand how this is possible. Email is supposed to be like paper mail — you send it, they get it, and you have no idea whether they read it or not. It bounces back to you if they never even receive it, say, because you addressed it incorrectly. The original conception of email is completely private.</p>

        <p>But also, the original conception of email is that messages are plain text. No fonts, no styles, just plain text, with optional attachments. But those attachments are embedded in the message, not pulled from a server when the message is viewed. </p>

        <p>Once we allowed email clients to act as de facto web browsers, loading remote content from servers when messages are viewed, we opened up not just a can of worms but an entire case of canned worms. Every privacy exploit for a web browser is now a privacy exploit for email. But it’s worse, because people naturally assume that email is completely private. </p>

        <p>Read receipts should be under the control of the recipient, not the sender. Full stop. The strength of email is that it is open and decentralized, but that’s email’s weakness too. No closed messaging platform that I’m aware of allows for read receipts that are controlled by the sender, not the recipient.</p>

        <p>I think Superhuman should be ashamed of themselves for building this feature in the first place — particularly the geo-tracking. But ultimately, <em>email clients should defend against this</em>. The fact that this nonconsensual tracking is even possible should be treated as a serious bug in all email clients. Apple Mail — both on Mac and iOS — allows you to disable loading of remote images as a preference, but that breaks most graphically rich emails. Mail clients should allow remote images but load them anonymously, through a proxy server perhaps. I’m sure it’s a tricky problem to solve, but I’m convinced it can be solved.</p>

        <p>Great column from Matt Levine, writing for Bloomberg:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>But the process wouldn’t be a <em>one-on-one negotiation</em>. It’s not
        like Congress would say “we want to regulate your data collection
        practices” and Facebook would say “hmm no we’d rather you didn’t”
        and Congress would say “okay you have good lawyers we give up.”
        Facebook’s main leverage against the FTC — “we don’t think we did
        anything wrong and if you insist on restricting our data
        collection we will see you in court” — just wouldn’t work to stop
        Congress from making a <em>law</em>, because it is irrelevant. Congress
        can make a law about data privacy even if no one has broken any
        previous laws. In fact that’s the best reason to make a law!
        “There is a bad thing that is happening, and there is no law
        against it, so we should make a law against it”: That is a
        perfectly sensible line of reasoning!</p>

        forward, though, navigation-equipped BMWs will come with CarPlay

        <blockquote>
          <p>Tag cleaners, as they call themselves, drown out gore, harassment,
        and more by flooding a user’s tagged photos with pleasant images.
        It’s benevolent spam. The most prolific accounts are usually
        reposting the same images ad nauseam in quick bursts.
        Randomfloweracc, run by a 17-year-old named Lori, uses cartoons
        like Rilakkuma or Hello Kitty. Naomi, owner of cute.cleanup, is
        also partial to Sanrio characters and rainbows. […]</p>

        <p>Instagram appears to have removed all of the tagged photos of
        Devins’ death, but there’s little to stop abusers from creating
        new accounts and restarting the cycle again. In the days
        following her death, The Verge noticed waves of these photos,
        both originating from the same accounts constantly reposting, as
        well as multiple new accounts cropping up. Reports filed by The
        Verge usually resulted in photos being taken down in minutes; but
        in some cases, that’s all it takes for any user to see them to
        begin with.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>What these “tag cleaners” are doing is clearly good. It’s heartwarming that they spend so much time on this. But it’s heart<em>breaking</em> that they have to do this in the first place. If Facebook truly cared, they could stop this hateful trolling in its tracks.</p>

        <p>But the design clearly presaged what we now know as the modern iMac, which effectively is the modern desktop: all-in-one design, LCD display (this was truly radical in 1997), good built-in speakers, and an attempt to minimize the tangle of cables most PCs and Macs had in the back.

        <p>I’m <a href="https://daringfireball.net/s/studio+neat">a big fan of Studio Neat</a>, the two-man design studio of Tom Gerhardt and Dan Provost. Their <a href="https://www.studioneat.com/products/glif">Glif</a> is an amazing iPhone tripod mount (works with any size iPhone, or any other phone for that matter), and their <a href="https://www.studioneat.com/products/canopy">Canopy</a> turns Apple’s Magic Keyboard into my favorite portable iPad keyboard.</p>

        <p>One of their most recent products is a pen: <a href="https://www.studioneat.com/products/markone">the Mark One</a>. I’m using one as my daily carry right now (with a custom 3D-printed converter that lets me use <a href="https://daringfireball.net/s/zebra+sarasa">my beloved Zebra Sarasa</a> 0.5mm ink cartridges<sup>*</sup>). It’s a very nice pen and a beautiful, functional object. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, they’ve created a limited edition version, on sale in an 8-day Kickstarter campaign that coincides with the dates of the Apollo 11 mission. The project is already funded three times over — most likely, I suppose, from fans of the standard Mark One — and this is the only opportunity to buy this edition. I’m in.</p>

        <p>See also: <a href="https://www.relay.fm/tc/52">Gerhardt and Provost talk about the Apollo Edition on the latest edition of their podcast, Thoroughly Considered</a>.</p>

        <p><small>
        * For years, I swore by 0.4mm Sarasas. But now that I’m older and my eyesight is deteriorating, I can’t print as small as I used to, so I switched to 0.5mm a while back and now I can’t believe I ever used the 0.4mm pens for so long. A tenth of a millimeter sounds like a negligible difference, but in practice, it’s the difference between “very fine” and “fine”.

        all the stuff ping-ponging around his brain, I’m grateful I
        cannot. But always, I wish I could write like him. Jayson’s
        writing is conversational, entertaining and often laugh-out-loud
        funny. He doesn’t take himself seriously. But he takes his
        audience extremely seriously, and considers no detail too small in
        his service of the reader.</p>

        <p>Among his many attributes, Jayson has a knack for engaging
        relatively obscure veterans who are keen observers of the game,
        and then elevating them to oracles in his columns. After a long
        night of October baseball, 99 percent of us will gather in the
        clubhouse around the star of the game. Jayson will be off in the
        corner, talking to whoever he has identified as this year’s Corky
        Miller or Casey Candaele or Skip Schumaker or Mark DeRosa — and
        naturally, getting the best stuff.</p>

        <p>I enjoyed this quite a bit, but the big thing Ritson misses is that the fundamental reason why Apple’s brand is differentiated from its competitors isn’t about its advertising — it’s about the products themselves. The products themselves are differentiated — only iPhones run iOS, only Macs run MacOS. That’s where it starts, and the advertising only serves to point out <em>how</em> the products are different and <em>why</em> they’re better. The “Think Different” campaign was an exception, but that’s because at the time, Apple’s fundamental problem was that its products were not differentiated enough. That’s the thing many people misunderstand about Apple’s “product marketing” team. They don’t come in at the end and figure out how to advertise finished products; they’re right there at the beginning, helping define what the products actually are.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>They say a James Bond movie is only as good as its villain. That’s not always true—weak bad guys unwind fantastic Bond movies. Stellar villains elevate terrible installments. While England’s top spy has gone head-to-head against a variety of foes, you can’t deny that some have served as meatier adversaries as others. That’s why we have to do what any Bond fan must do: rank every single James Bond villain in a big list.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Points to Hall for comprehensiveness — there are 24 Bond movies, with at least one boss and several henchmen in each film. I think he gets the order largely right, but there’s a lot to quibble with. (5th place isn’t shabby on a list of 104, but I’d rank Auric Goldfinger in the top 3, <em>at least</em> — he’s the quintessential Bond villain.)</p>

        <p>The other thing I disagree with is putting Blofeld down as a single character. He appears in 7 films but, in the films in which we see his face, was never played by the same actor twice (yet). Hall’s rankings include the actors’ performances — I’d say each actor’s Blofeld should be included separately — or at least we need a separate list of ranked Blofelds. I’d go with: Donald Pleasence, Christoph Waltz, Charles Gray, Telly Savalas, Max von Sydow — and I’d probably put Pleasence’s Blofeld in the top 3 overall. Like Goldfinger, he’s quintessential. And the goofy unnamed “Blofeld” whom Roger Moore’s Bond tosses out of a helicopter and into a chimney in the dreadfully awkward  opening scene of <em>For Your Eyes Only</em> ought to be dead last on the whole list.</p>

        <h6 class="dateline">Tuesday, 16 July 2019</h6>

        <p><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/ringcentral-and-zhumu-customers-vulnerability">Nicole Nguyen, reporting for BuzzFeed News</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>The fallout from <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/zoom-webcam-hacker-watching-you-vulnerability">Zoom’s massive webcam vulnerability</a>
        continues. In <a href="https://twitter.com/karanlyons/status/1150774640899317760">a report published today</a>, security researcher
        Karan Lyons shows that the same flaw — which gave attackers easy
        access to laptop cameras and microphones — affects RingCentral,
        which is used by over 350,000 businesses, as well as Zhumu,
        essentially the Chinese version of Zoom.</p>

        <p>On July 16, Apple confirmed that it had released another silent
        update to Macs patching the vulnerability affecting Zoom’s partner
        apps. The update, which went out this morning, requires no user
        action, but may take some time to roll out to all impacted Macs.
        Lyons tweeted that Apple’s latest update takes action on 11
        different apps, all vulnerable to the Zoom webcam flaw.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>So here’s an interesting question. I’ve <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/07/10/nguyen-zoom">been</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/07/11/macos-zoom-update">using</a> the phrase “nonconsensual technology” to describe Zoom’s invisible web server that remained installed and running even after you deleted the Zoom app. But when Apple first issued a silent, emergency system update to remove Zoom’s software, a few DF readers emailed or <a href="https://twitter.com/braz/status/1149453237843582978">tweeted</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mwa4/status/1149675707016105985">to ask</a>: <em>Isn’t this “nonconsensual technology” too?</em></p>

        <p>Clearly, the answer sounds like yes at first. Users get no indication of the update, and “requires no user action” makes it sound like it’s mandatory. But there <em>is</em> a setting to control this, allowing Mac users to disable the automatic installation of such updates. On MacOS 10.14 Mojave, it’s in System Prefs → Software Update → Advanced (<a href="/misc/2019/07/macos-10-14-system-prefs.png">screenshot</a>); on 10.13 High Sierra, it’s in System Prefs → App Store (<a href="/misc/2019/07/macos-10-13-system-prefs.png">screenshot</a>). In both versions, the checkbox is labeled “Install system data files and security updates”, and resides at the bottom of the section that controls what gets installed automatically.</p>

        <p>This option is enabled by default — even if you choose to install regular system updates manually — which is why the vast majority of Mac users are getting these “silent” updates automatically. But if you disable this option, even these silent updates won’t be installed automatically. I confirmed this with an Apple spokesperson, who emphasized that Apple only issues such updates “extremely judiciously”. Any pending security updates will be installed the next time you manually update software.</p>

        <p>I think Apple has struck a nearly perfect balance here, between doing what’s right for most users (installing these rare emergency updates automatically) and doing what’s right for power users who really do want to control when updates — even essential ones — are installed. I also think Apple is doing the right thing by going to the press and explaining when they issue such updates. If I could tweak anything, it would be to have these updates show up in the regular list of pending software updates <em>if</em> you have “Install system data files and security updates” turned off.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Apple Is Sending Out Another Silent Update To Fix the Webcam Flaw in Zoom’s Partner Apps’" href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/07/another_zoom_update">&#9733;</a></p>

          <p>“In our core search business, consumers can choose among a range
        of options: Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, and many more,” Cohen said.

        including companies like Amazon, eBay, Kayak, Travelocity, Yelp,
        and others.”</p>

        <p>But recent statistics paint a different picture. According to
        StatCounter, Google accounts for over 92% of the search engine
        market share worldwide as of this June.</p>

        <p>Its closest competitor, Bing, accounted for just over 2.5% of

        <p><em>Competition</em> isn’t the right word. Yes, there are competing search engines, clearly. The right word is <em>monopoly</em>, and it’s just as clear that Google has a very strong monopoly on the search engine market. Monopolies aren’t illegal — but monopoly holders are subject to regulations that non-monopoly competitors are not. That’s the issue. Google’s argument shouldn’t be to simply say that they have competition, it should be to say that they compete fairly.</p>

        <p>That might be a tough argument for them to make while under oath.</p>

        the moon, or indeed the one Omega introduced way back in 1957, as
        a tool for race-car drivers.</p>

        <p>It is unchanged because there’s nothing <em>to</em> change: The
        mechanical watch is, along with the bicycle, an arguably perfect
        invention. If wound every day and serviced regularly, it can run

        <h6 class="dateline">Monday, 15 July 2019</h6>

        <p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/07/15/word-1-billion">Speaking of</a> Microsoft and mobile, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18715202/microsoft-bill-gates-android-biggest-mistake-interview">this story caught my eye a few weeks ago</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has been reflecting on his time at
        the company when crucial decisions were made over its mobile
        operating system. During a recent interview at Village Global, a
        venture capital firm, Gates revealed his “greatest mistake ever”
        was Microsoft missing the Android opportunity:</p>

        <p>“In the software world, particularly for platforms, these are
        winner-take-all markets. So the greatest mistake ever is whatever
        mismanagement I engaged in that caused Microsoft not to be what
        Android is. That is, Android is the standard non-Apple phone
        platform. That was a natural thing for Microsoft to win. It really
        is winner take all. If you’re there with half as many apps or 90
        percent as many apps, you’re on your way to complete doom. There’s
        room for exactly one non-Apple operating system and what’s that
        worth? $400 billion that would be transferred from company G to
        company M.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>A lot of the response to this has focused — correctly — on the antitrust implications of Gates’s “winner takes all” acknowledgement. Nilay Patel had a strong take: “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18715702/bill-gates-regulate-platforms-network-effect-android-mistake-microsoft">Bill Gates Accidentally Makes the Case to Regulate the Hell Out of Platform Companies</a>”.<sup id="fnr1-2019-07-15"><a href="#fn1-2019-07-15">1</a></sup></p>

        <p>But I’m fascinated by the way he phrased the opportunity that Google seized with Android: to be “the standard non-Apple phone platform”. It’s just assumed in his thinking that the iPhone would have been the iPhone no matter what. Historically, that sounds bananas coming out of Bill Gates’s mouth.</p>

        <p>You can make a strong case, too, that Apple might not have survived its 1996-97 nadir without Microsoft’s support. I’ve always felt <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/08/dayintech-0806/">the $150 million investment in Apple</a> that Microsoft made in 1997 was overrated. It just wasn’t <em>that</em> much money, even for Apple at that time.<sup id="fnr2-2019-07-15"><a href="#fn2-2019-07-15">2</a></sup> It was symbolic theater — and it worked. The value for Apple wasn’t the money itself but the public show of confidence from Microsoft — the message that Microsoft was supporting Apple, not trying to crush them.</p>

        <p>But the real benefit for Apple — the factor that I think truly helped save the company — was securing a promise that Microsoft would continue to work on Office for Mac for at least another five years. And it wasn’t just token “support” — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_98_Macintosh_Edition">Office 98 for Mac</a> was a major update and <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/rick_schaut/2004/02/26/mac-word-6-0/">truly improved the Mac-like-ness of the apps</a>. Here we are 22 years later and the Office for Mac apps are chart-toppers in the App Store.</p>

        <p>I don’t think it’s hyperbole to argue that the Mac probably wouldn’t have survived without Office, and possibly without a <em>good</em> version of Office. And in 1997 Apple wouldn’t have survived if the Mac platform hadn’t made a resurgence. Apple’s own iWork suite — Pages, Numbers, Keynote — didn’t ship until 2005. Microsoft Office singlehandedly kept the Mac a credible platform for classic productivity apps for 8 years.</p>

        <p>There were other third-party developers that Apple was dependent upon back then. Adobe certainly comes to mind — Apple needed the graphic design and illustration market, and that required (and still does require) Adobe’s pro apps. But it was never in Adobe’s interest <em>not</em> to continue supporting the Mac. If anything, it was in Adobe’s own interest to see the Mac thrive so that Adobe wouldn’t be dependent solely upon Microsoft and Windows.</p>

        <p>Microsoft, of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.">had some serious antitrust problems in the ’90s</a>. If not for U.S. v. Microsoft, though, I wonder whether Gates would’ve chosen to drop Office for Mac and let Apple wither. I’m not saying anyone could have or should have predicted the iPhone and Apple’s dominance of mobile profits all the way back in 1997. Nobody really predicted what the iPhone would be in 2007, even. But if Microsoft had an inkling of what the iPhone would become, and where Android would come in and take over as, in Gates’s own words, “the standard non-Apple phone platform” by fast-following the iPhone’s basic all-display, all-multitouch design, maybe they’d have thought differently about helping Apple recover in 1997. With no Office 98, there might not have been an Apple to even make the iPhone in 2007. And <a href="https://www.technobuffalo.com/android-before-and-after-the-iphone">with no iPhone in 2007</a> it’s impossible to say what the mobile phone state of the art would look like today. Without the iPhone, I think there’s a chance the mobile market would have continued on the same course it was on before the iPhone: dominated by crap software and BlackBerry-style hardware, with the carriers calling the shots. In that world, Microsoft might’ve had a chance.</p>

        <p>If losing the mobile market to Android was Gates’s biggest mistake, you can argue it started when he agreed to support Apple and the Mac in 1997.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘On Bill Gates’s ‘Greatest Mistake Ever’’" href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/07/gates_biggest_mistake">&#9733;</a></p>

        <p>I’d be curious to hear Gates’s take on the console market, where there are <em>two</em> longstanding platforms — PlayStation and Xbox — sharing the non-Nintendo segment of the market. (Clearly Nintendo is the Apple of gaming.) With better licensing terms (Android being free of charge and open source was a huge boon compared to Microsoft’s mobile licensing) and a faster follow on an iPhone-inspired design, I’m not convinced that Windows Phone could not have been Xbox to Android’s Playstation.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2019-07-15"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

        incredibly popular, many people (and large corporations) still
        operate on good ol’ Microsoft Office. The Word text processor was
        Microsoft’s first Android app to pass 500 million installs on the
        Play Store, and a little over a year later, it has now passed the
        1 billion mark.</p>

        <p>As with most apps that reach this many installations, the count
        isn’t made up entirely of downloads from the Play Store. Microsoft
        has agreements with Samsung and other manufacturers to pre-install
        Word (and several other apps) on phones and tablets, so there’s a
        good chance many of those billion installations come from devices
        where the app has never been opened.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The Office apps are very popular on iOS too, of course. It makes sense that Microsoft put so much effort into trying get Windows Phone off the ground — they knew that mobile was going to be a huge part of the Office franchise. Turns out it just wasn’t on their own platform.</p>

        <p>Reed Albergotti and Tony Romm, reporting for The Washington Post:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>While Apple formally supports the notion of a federal privacy law,
        the company has yet to formally back any bills proposed on the
        Hill — unlike Microsoft. “I would argue there’s a need for Apple
        to be a more vocal part of this debate,” said Sen. Mark R. Warner
        (D-Va.), a fierce critic of tech companies for their privacy
        violations. […]</p>

        <p>“If you are going to use the value of privacy in your marketing, I
        think you have an obligation to your consumers to tell us what
        that means,” said India McKinney, a legislative analyst for the
        Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties organization
        that advocates for Internet privacy and security.</p>

        <p>McKinney noted that Apple hasn’t signed on to privacy legislation
        that other companies, such as Web browser DuckDuckGo, have
        supported, including an amendment to the new California law that
        prevents consumer data collection by default and gives citizens
        the right to sue tech companies for violations. If Apple were to
        throw its weight behind strong privacy protections even at the
        state level, it would help counter pressure from other large tech
        companies to water down the legislation, she said. “That would
        make headlines. That would be really useful,” she said.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Interesting dilemma on this one. I can see the argument that without backing specific legislation, Apple’s privacy stance is insular, guiding only its own products and services. But do we really want any private companies, even Apple, dictating the terms of public policy? Do Facebook and Google get a seat at the table?</p>

        <p>From some other perspectives, that $5 billion fine is a big deal, of course: it’s the biggest fine in FTC history, far bigger than the $22 million fine levied against Google in 2012. And $5 billion is a lot of money, to be sure. It’s just that like everything else that comes into contact with Facebook’s scale, it’s still entirely too small: Facebook had $15 billion in revenue last quarter alone, and $22 billion in <em>profit</em> last year.</p>

        disappearing from the App Store in 2011.</p>

        <p>In the eight years since the game’s release, Apple has left the
        iOS game market to third-party developers, with the exception of
        Warren Buffett’s Paper Wizard. Today, however, the company
        released an updated version, which was spotted by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/07/08/apple-revives-classic-texas-hold-em-ios-game-to-mark-10-years-of-the-app-store/">an eagle-eyed
        9to5Mac reader</a>. Strangely, the game’s description says the
        release is meant to celebrate the App Store’s 10th Anniversary,
        which occurred last July 10th, not quite 11 years ago today.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>I find this so fascinating. First, I actually enjoy this game. I’m sure there are better poker games in the App Store now — or at least smarter ones — but the game mechanics of this one, in landscape mode, are just fun. But why bring it back now? Why say it’s to commemorate the App Store’s 10th anniversary after its 11th anniversary? Was this meant for last year but held up for a year for some reason?</p>

        <p>It’s also interesting what they’ve updated and what they haven’t. They’ve switched the font to San Francisco (but maybe that’s just because they were always specifying the system font), and it adapts to fit the iPhone X-class displays, but there’s still no iPad version and still no iCloud syncing across devices. For the most part, the game seems unchanged. Oh, and in a sign of the times, the price dropped from $4.99 to free.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission has endorsed a roughly $5 billion
        settlement with Facebook Inc. over a long-running probe into the
        tech giant’s privacy missteps, according to people familiar with
        the matter.</p>

        <p>FTC commissioners this past week voted 3-2 in favor of the
        agreement, with the Republican majority backing the pact while
        Democratic commissioners objected, the people said. The matter has
        been moved to the Justice Department’s civil division and it is
        unclear how long it will take to finalize, one of the people said.
        Justice Department reviews are part of FTC procedure but typically
        don’t change the outcome of a decision by the commission.</p>

Although we are not aware of any use of the vulnerability against a customer and specific conditions and sequences of events are required to exploit it, we take the security and privacy of our customers extremely seriously.

          <p>Apple has released a silent update for Mac users removing a
        vulnerable component in Zoom, the popular video conferencing app,
        which allowed websites to automatically add a user to a video call
        without their permission.</p>

        <p>The Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant told TechCrunch that the
        update — now released — removes the hidden web server, which
        Zoom quietly installed on users’ Macs when they installed the app.</p>

        <p>Apple said the update does not require any user interaction and is
        deployed automatically.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>That’s the end of that chapter. I forgot to mention the other day that the worst part about Zoom’s local web server is that if you deleted the Zoom app, the web server would silently reinstall the Zoom app if a website you visited requested it. That phrase <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/07/10/nguyen-zoom">I quoted yesterday</a>, “nonconsensual technology”, really sums it up. I’ll go out on a limb and say Apple is none too pleased about this. I can’t think of a better example to explain why we — which is to say honest Mac users and developers — are stuck with ever-tightening sandbox restrictions on the Mac.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>But it was the 1992-1998 HBO comedy “The Larry Sanders Show” for which Torn will be perhaps best remembered. For playing Artie, the doggedly loyal attack dog of a producer who runs the eponymous show and manages the fragile ego of its star, Torn was widely acclaimed. He received six Emmy nominations, winning once in 1996, and over the show’s run was also nominated for two American Comedy awards (winning one), an American Television Award, and four Cable Ace awards (winning one), among many other accolades.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>One of the hardest things to do in cinema — whether movies or TV — is convey a palpable, <em>credible</em> sense of camaraderie. It takes great writing, great acting, and perfect casting. “The Larry Sanders Show” is, depending on my mood, my favorite TV show of all time. And the heart of the show was the unwavering friendship between Artie and Larry.</p>
